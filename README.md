How to Run:

Run the main script: Single_Objective_optimization.py
 It performs parameter calibration using the CellML model.

Output plots and results are saved in:
Ca_OpenCOR_Calibration_2025/outputs/Single_objective/run2/

After each run, a row is added to a CSV file in the same folder.
 This includes the optimized cost, updated parameters, and their bounds.
Example plots and CSV outputs from previous runs are also provided in the folder.
